# Schema Design 

The project consists of three entities, the workout lists, the specific workouts, and the users. There is a one to many relationship between the workout list (the one), and the workouts (many). Where one workout list can contain many workouts. 

### workout list
 * Each workout list has an id number as a primary key.
 * Each workout list has a unique title.

### workouts
 * Each workout has an id number as a primary key.
 * Each workout has a title. The title doesn't have to be unique.
 * Each workout can be either done or undone. Undone is the default state for new workouts.
 * Each workout belongs to a workout list. This relationship uses a foreign key that references the workout list.
